The problem was:

Build a client-server application using semaphore and shared memory.

The client should send 2 numbers to the server using the shared memory.

The sever should contains the following functionalities:

1. Calculate results for all shared memory.

2. Print the shared memory content

The client should wait until the result finalized then prints the summation.

Use semaphore where it needed.
